# ETL-AND-VISUALIZATION-PROJECTT
📘 End-to-End ETL & Visualization Project
🚀 Introduction

This is a hands-on project that we worked on as a team to apply a complete ETL Pipeline, starting from extracting data from multiple sources (Web Scraping, CSV, JSON), cleaning and transforming it, storing it in databases, and finally creating meaningful insights through visualizations using Power BI and Python.

1️⃣ Data Sources

📄 JSON file

🌐 Web Scraping with Python (BeautifulSoup & Selenium)

📊 CSV files

2️⃣ ETL Process
🔹 Extract

Collected data from different sources (Web + Local Files).

🔹 Transform (Preprocessing & Cleaning)

Used Pandas + Regex for cleaning.

Handled missing values.

Normalized formats (e.g., prices).

Removed duplicates.

🔹 Load

Stored the final dataset in SQL Server and MongoDB.

3️⃣ Storage

SQL Server → Structured relational storage.

MongoDB → Flexible NoSQL storage for semi-structured data.

4️⃣ Visualization

📊 Power BI → Interactive dashboards for trends & insights.

🐍 Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn) → Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

This project was a great opportunity to apply end-to-end Data Engineering and connect ETL processes with Visualization.

A big thank you 🙏 to our instructor (Eng. Abdullah Mahmoud) for the guidance and support, and special thanks to my amazing team 💪 for the collaboration and effort throughout the project.
